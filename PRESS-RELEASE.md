## Heading ##
  > Local Scavenger Hunt / DiscoverLocal / Urban Explorer / Extravert / Afoot / Wanderlust 

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Curate your city’s hidden gems for others to fall in love with or cure your wanderlust by exploring the city through a new perspective. 

## Summary ##
  > Ever eaten Ike's Daemon Bruce? Or bought a sword at the Mission pirate shop and challenged someone to a duel? Go on a solo adventure or invite your friends to explore scavenger hunts created by city veterans.

  > Love your city, and want to share your favorite spots with the world? Spread the love by creating a scavenger hunt for fellow urban explorers to enjoy.

## Problem ##
> Popular travel sites do not offer resources for fully immersing yourself and exploring a city. They focus on advertising commercial events and standard tourist attractions, while completely omitting many of the greatest secrets around town.

## Solution ##
> {Scavenger Hunt} distills local knowledge into tours and games that cost you nothing to explore. It’s a great way to get to know a new city, or rediscover your home town, like having a few dozen locals show you around town whenever you’re ready to go.

> Wanderlust is a beautiful feeling and we want to provide you with the right map for your journey. Share the joys of exploration and set up your own scavenger hunt for others to discover. Or take the plunge on an adventure of your own, laid out by a playful expert around town.

## Customer Quote ##
  > “The San Francisco Mission scavenger hunt was an entire day’s worth of adventure. I had no idea any of these places existed, and would have never been able to find them on Trip Advisor or Google. It was like I had a friend lead me around town the whole time. ”

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Curate a trip. Go explore. Cure wanderlust.
